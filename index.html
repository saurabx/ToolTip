                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to structure the content and layout of web pages. It defines the elements and structure of a webpage using tags, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms. HTML provides the foundation for organizing and presenting information on the web.</p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS is a style sheet language that works alongside HTML to control the presentation and appearance of web pages. It allows developers to define styles, such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing, and apply them consistently across multiple web pages. CSS separates the content and structure (handled by HTML) from the visual design, making it easier to update and maintain the look and feel of a website.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that enables interactive and dynamic behavior on web pages. It adds interactivity, responsiveness, and functionality to websites. With JavaScript, you can handle events, manipulate HTML elements, perform calculations, validate forms, create animations, make AJAX requests to fetch data from servers, and much more. JavaScript is widely used in web development to create interactive user experiences.</p>
